# Play [2.4 to 2.8] PDF module

`play2-scala-pdf` is a Play Framework module to help generate PDF documents dynamically from Play Framework web application.

It simply renders Play Framework HTML and CSS-based view templates to PDF via [Flying Saucer library], which uses [OpenPDF], an open-source LGPL and MPL version of an older fork of iText for PDF generation.

### Supported Play Framework and Scala Versions

The supported Scala and Play versions as follows:

|           | Scala 2.10 | Scala 2.11 | Scala 2.12 | Scala 2.13 |
| --------- |:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|
| Play 2.4  | `YES`      | `YES`      |            |            |
| Play 2.5  |            | `YES`      |            |            |
| Play 2.6  |            | `YES`      | `YES`      |            |
| Play 2.7  |            | `YES`      | `YES`      | `YES`      |
| Play 2.8  |            |            | `YES`      | `YES`      |

### Play Framework Java

If you are using Play Framework Java, check out [https://github.com/innoveit/play2-pdf](https://github.com/innoveit/play2-pdf).

`play2-scala-pdf` is a fork of the project above with the aim to reduce the final distribution size for Play Framework Scala projects by rebasing the module to Play Framework Scala core (i.e. avoid including Play Framework Java additions in Play Framework Scala projects).

## Installation

Create a PDF generator factory method in your application's Guice module:
``` scala
@Provides
def providePdfGenerator(): PdfGenerator = {
  val pdfGen = new PdfGenerator()
  pdfGen.loadLocalFonts(Seq("fonts/opensans-regular.ttf"))
  pdfGen
}
```

Currently, the module is hosted at Maven Central Repository. Include the following lines in ```build.sbt```, then reload SBT to resolve and enable the module:
``` scala
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  ...
  "com.hhandoko" %% "play28-scala-pdf" % "4.3.0" // Use `play27-scala-pdf` for Play 2.7.x apps, etc.
)
```

Remember to add Sonatype snapshots repository to use snapshot releases:
``` scala
resolvers ++= Seq(
  Resolver.sonatypeRepo("snapshots")
)
```

*NOTE: If you are using an IDE like Eclipse, remember to re-generate your project files.*

## Usage

You can use a standard Play Framework Scala template like this one:
``` html
@(message: String)

@main("Example Page") {
    Image: <img src="/public/images/favicon.png"/><br/>
    Hello world! <br/>
    @message <br/>
}
```

Then this template, after having imported ```com.hhandoko.play.pdf.PdfGenerator```, can simply be rendered as:
``` scala
class HomeController @Inject() (pdfGen: PdfGenerator) extends Controller {

    def examplePdf = Action { pdfGen.ok(views.html.example(), "http://localhost:9000") }

}
```

where ```pdfGenerator.ok``` is a simple shorthand notation for:
``` scala
ok(pdfGenerator.toBytes(document.render("Your new application is ready."), "http://localhost:9000")).as("application/pdf")
```

## Template rules

Please observe the following constraints to avoid issues when using this module:

  - Avoid using `media="screen"` qualifier on linked CSS in `<head>`, otherwise you must provide specific print stylesheets (i.e. `media="print"`)
  - Non-system fonts must be loaded explicitly (see below for example)
  - External assets such as images need to be loaded as base64-encoded string
  - External such as stylesheets will be loaded as per normal HTML page load

*NOTE: If the specified URI is a path into Play Framework app classpath, the resource is loaded directly instead. See the above sample template for an example.*

Fonts can be loaded by invoking `PdfGenerator.loadLocalFonts` method. For example:

  - if fonts are stored under `/conf/fonts` (or other project path mapped to the classpath),
  - it can be loaded by invoking `pdfGenerator.loadLocalFonts(Seq("fonts/FreeSans.ttf"))`

*NOTE: Non-system fonts in this context refers to WebFonts, fonts not available to the Java VM, or other fonts not included as part of normal OS distribution*
